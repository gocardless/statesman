Statesman is a little different from other state machine libraries which tack
state behaviour directly onto a model. A statesman state machine is defined as a
separate class which is instantiated with the model to which it should
apply. State transitions are also modelled as a class which can optionally be
persisted to the database for a full audit history, including JSON metadata
which can be set during a transition.

This data model allows for interesting things like using a different state
machine depending on the value of a model attribute.

## TL;DR Usage

```ruby
class OrderStateMachine
  include Statesman::Machine

  state :pending, initial: true
  state :checking_out
  state :purchased
  state :shipped
  state :cancelled
  state :failed
  state :refunded

  transition from: :pending,      to: [:checking_out, :cancelled]
  transition from: :checking_out, to: [:purchased, :cancelled]
  transition from: :purchased,    to: [:shipped, :failed]
  transition from: :shipped,      to: :refunded

  guard_transition(to: :checking_out) do |order|
    order.products_in_stock?
  end

  before_transition(from: :checking_out, to: :cancelled) do |order, transition|
    order.reallocate_stock
  end

  before_transition(to: :purchased) do |order, transition|
    PaymentService.new(order).submit
  end

  after_transition(to: :purchased) do |order, transition|
    MailerService.order_confirmation(order).deliver
  end
end

class Order < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :order_transitions

  def state_machine
    OrderStateMachine.new(self, transition_class: OrderTransition)
  end
end

class OrderTransition < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Statesman::Adapters::ActiveRecordTransition

  belongs_to :order, inverse_of: :order_transitions
end

Order.first.state_machine.current_state
# => "pending"

Order.first.state_machine.can_transition_to?(:cancelled)
# => true/false

Order.first.state_machine.transition_to(:cancelled, optional: :metadata)
# => true/false

Order.first.state_machine.transition_to!(:cancelled)
# => true/exception
```

## Persistence

By default Statesman stores transition history in memory only. It can be
persisted by configuring Statesman to use a different adapter. For example,
ActiveRecord within Rails:

`config/initializers/statesman.rb`:

```ruby
Statesman.configure do
  storage_adapter(Statesman::Adapters::ActiveRecord)
end
```

Generate the transition model:

```bash
$ rails g statesman:active_record_transition Order OrderTransition
```

And add an association from the parent model:

`app/models/order.rb`:

```ruby
class Order < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :order_transitions

  # Initialize the state machine
  def state_machine
    @state_machine ||= OrderStateMachine.new(self, transition_class: OrderTransition)
  end

  # Optionally delegate some methods
  delegate :can_transition_to?, :transition_to!, :transition_to, :current_state,
           to: :state_machine
end
```

## Configuration

#### `storage_adapter`

```ruby
Statesman.configure do
  storage_adapter(Statesman::Adapters::ActiveRecord)
  # ...or
  storage_adapter(Statesman::Adapters::Mongoid)
end
```
Statesman defaults to storing transitions in memory. If you're using rails, you
can instead configure it to persist transitions to the database by using the
ActiveRecord or Mongoid adapter.


## Class methods

#### `Machine.state`
```ruby
Machine.state(:some_state, initial: true)
Machine.state(:another_state)
```
Define a new state and optionally mark as the initial state.

#### `Machine.transition`
```ruby
Machine.transition(from: :some_state, to: :another_state)
```
Define a transition rule. Both method parameters are required, `to` can also be
an array of states (`.transition(from: :some_state, to: [:another_state, :some_other_state])`).

#### `Machine.guard_transition`
```ruby
Machine.guard_transition(from: :some_state, to: another_state) do |object|
  object.some_boolean?
end
```
Define a guard. `to` and `from` parameters are optional, a nil parameter means
guard all transitions. The passed block should evaluate to a boolean and must
be idempotent as it could be called many times.

#### `Machine.before_transition`
```ruby
Machine.before_transition(from: :some_state, to: another_state) do |object|
  object.side_effect
end
```
Define a callback to run before a transition. `to` and `from` parameters are
optional, a nil parameter means run before all transitions. This callback can
have side-effects as it will only be run once immediately before the transition.

#### `Machine.after_transition`
```ruby
Machine.after_transition(from: :some_state, to: another_state) do |object, transition|
  object.side_effect
end
```
Define a callback to run after a successful transition. `to` and `from`
parameters are optional, a nil parameter means run after all transitions. The
model object and transition object are passed as arguments to the callback.
This callback can have side-effects as it will only be run once immediately
after the transition.

#### `Machine.new`
```ruby
my_machine = Machine.new(my_model, transition_class: MyTransitionModel)
```
Initialize a new state machine instance. `my_model` is required. If using the
ActiveRecord adapter `my_model` should have a `has_many` association with
`MyTransitionModel`.

## Instance methods

#### `Machine#current_state`
Returns the current state based on existing transition objects.

#### `Machine#history`
Returns a sorted array of all transition objects.

#### `Machine#last_transition`
Returns the most recent transition object.

#### `Machine#can_transition_to?(:state)`
Returns true if the current state can transition to the passed state and all
applicable guards pass.

#### `Machine#transition_to!(:state)`
Transition to the passed state, returning `true` on success. Raises
`Statesman::GuardFailedError` or `Statesman::TransitionFailedError` on failure.

#### `Machine#transition_to(:state)`
Transition to the passed state, returning `true` on success. Swallows all
exceptions and returns false on failure.

## Testing with RSpec
```ruby
require 'spec_helper'
describe OrderStateMachine do
  describe 'states' do
    before :each do
      @order = create(:order)
      @state_machine = OrderStateMachine.new(@order, transition_class: OrderTransition)
    end

    it 'has initial state pending' do
      expect(@state_machine.current_state).to eql "pending"
    end

    context "pending" do
      it "transitions to checking_out" do
        @state_machine.transition_to!(:checking_out)
        expect(@state_machine.current_state).to eql "checking_out"
      end
      it "transitions to cancelled" do
        @state_machine.transition_to!(:cancelled)
        expect(@state_machine.current_state).to eql "cancelled"
      end
    end
  end
end
```
