## Contributing

- Generally we welcome new features but please first open an issue where we 
  can discuss whether it fits with our vision for the project.
- Any new feature or bug fix needs an accompanying test case.
- No need to add to the changelog, we will take care of updating it as we make
  releases.

## Style

We use [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) to help maintain a
consistent code style across the project. Please check that your pull
request passes by running `rubocop`.
