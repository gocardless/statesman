## v4.1.2, 17th August 2019

- Add support for Rails 6 [@greysteil](https://github.com/gocardless/statesman/pull/360)

## v4.1.1, 6th July 2019

- Fix statesman index detection for indexes that start t-z [@hmarr](https://github.com/gocardless/statesman/pull/354)
- Correct access of metadata via `state_machine` [@glenpike](https://github.com/gocardless/statesman/pull/349)

## v4.1.0, 10 April 2019

- Add better support for mysql (and others) in `transition_conflict_error?` [@greysteil](https://github.com/greysteil) (https://github.com/gocardless/statesman/pull/342)

## v4.0.0, 22 February 2019

- Forces Statesman to use a new transactions with `requires_new: true` (https://github.com/gocardless/statesman/pull/249)
- Fixes an issue with `after_commit` transition blocks that where being
    executed even if the transaction rolled back. ([patch](https://github.com/gocardless/statesman/pull/338) by [@matid](https://github.com/matid))

## v3.5.0, 2 November 2018

- Expose `most_recent_transition_join` - ActiveRecords `or` requires that both
    sides of the query match up. Exposing this methods makes things easier if
    one side of the `or` uses `in_state` or `not_in_state`. (patch by [@adambutler](https://github.com/adambutler))
- Various Readme and CI related changes.

## v3.4.1, 14 February 2018 ❤️

- Support ActiveRecord transition classes which don't include `Statesman::Adapters::ActiveRecordTransition`, and thus don't have a `.updated_timestamp_column` method (see #310 for further details) (patch by [@timrogers](https://github.com/timrogers))

## v3.4.0, 12 February 2018

- When unsetting the `most_recent` flag during a transition, don't assume that transitions have an `updated_at` attribute, but rather allow the "updated timestamp column" to be re-configured or disabled entirely (patch by [@timrogers](https://github.com/timrogers))

## v3.3.0, 5 January 2018

- Touch `updated_at` on transitions when unsetting `most_recent` flag (patch by [@NGMarmaduke](https://github.com/NGMarmaduke))

## v2.0.1, 29 March 2016

- Add support for Rails 5 (excluding Mongoid adapter)

## v2.0.0, 5 January 2016

- No changes from v2.0.0.rc1

## v2.0.0.rc1, 23 December 2015

*Breaking changes*

- Unset most_recent after before transitions
  - TL;DR: set `autosave: false` on the `has_many` association between your parent and transition model and this change will almost certainly not affect your integration
  - Previously the `most_recent` flag would be set to `false` on all transitions during any `before_transition` callbacks
  - After this change, the `most_recent` flag will still be `true` for the previous transition during these callbacks
  - Whilst this behaviour is almost certainly what your integration already expected, as a result of it any attempt to save the new, as yet unpersisted, transition during a `before_transition` callback will result in a uniqueness error. In particular, if you have not set `autosave: false` on the `has_many` association between your parent and transition model then any attempt to save the parent model during a `before_transition` will result in an error
- Require a most_recent column on transition tables
  - The `most_recent` column, added in v1.2.0, is now required on all transition tables
  - This greatly speeds up queries on large tables
  - A zero-downtime migration path is outlined in the changelog for v1.2.0. You should use that migration path **before** upgrading to v2.0.0
- Increase default initial sort key to 10
- Drop support for Ruby 1.9.3, which reached end-of-life in February 2015
- Move support for events to a companion gem
  - Previously, Statesman supported the use of "events" to trigger transitions
  - To keep Statesman lightweight we've moved event functionality into the `statesman-events` gem
  - If you are using events, add `statesman-events` to your gemfile and include `Statesman::Events` in your state machines

*Changes*

- Add after_destroy hook to ActiveRecord transition model templates
- Add `in_state?` instance method to `Statesman::Machine`
- Add `force_reload` option to `Statesman::Machine#last_transition`

- Fix `in_state` queries with a custom `transition_name` (patch by [0tsuki](https://github.com/0tsuki))
- Fix `backfill_most_recent` rake task for databases that support partial indexes (patch by [greysteil](https://github.com/greysteil))

## v1.3.0, 20 June 2015

- Rename `last_transition` alias in `ActiveRecordQueries` to `most_recent_#{model_name}`, to allow merging of two such queries (patch by [@isaacseymour](https://github.com/isaacseymour))

## v1.2.5, 17 June 2015

- Make `backfill_most_recent` rake task db-agnostic (patch by [@timothyp](https://github.com/timothyp))

## v1.2.1, 24 March 2015

- Add support for Postgres 9.4's `jsonb` column type (patch by [@isaacseymour](https://github.com/isaacseymour))

## v1.2.0, 18 March 2015

*Changes*

- Add a `most_recent` column to transition tables to greatly speed up queries (ActiveRecord adapter only).
  - All queries are backwards-compatible, so everything still works without the new column.
  - The upgrade path is:
    - Generate and run a migration for adding the column, by running `rails generate statesman:add_most_recent <ParentModel> <TransitionModel>`.
    - Backfill the `most_recent` column on old records by running `rake statesman:backfill_most_recent[ParentModel] `.
    - Add constraints and indexes to the transition table that make use of the new field, by running `rails g statesman:add_constraints_to_most_recent <ParentModel> <TransitionModel>`.
  - The upgrade path has been designed to be zero-downtime, even on large tables. As a result, please note that queries will only use the `most_recent` field after the constraints have been added.
- `ActiveRecordQueries.{not_,}in_state` now accepts an array of states.
